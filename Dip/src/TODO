- OsiCpx message handling - seeing all messages twice
- projection for blocks to save memory (see SSR)
- clean-up and document parameter names
- Relax and Cut ---> what to do if no UB!?
  -- for now, force user to give some idea
- Decomp and Cut - first just do normal CPM + DC idea with farkas working
  --> from multi-poly.... 
  --> even during PC, x* --> decomp from other poly, then farks
- Volume -> DecompAlgoVC? or direct DecompVol?
- DecompInterface Idea
- parameters need to be stored in algo, if doing multi-poly... 
- really need multiple DecompModels? stored as a DecompApp?
- if depend on COIN or Alps
- UtilCoin, UtilAlps, ... others should be completely independent of COIN
 

The following are added by Jiadong

1. AlpsDecompSolution and DecompSolution needed to be aggregated into one 
   file, many duplicattion part in these two files

2. solution pool

3. solveRelaxed to add ray part, recomposeSolution to add ray part
Debug: 

harp2 : on the part of block identification part

1. in phase I, if time limit is reached. It should return 
   time limit reached rather than infeasible
2.
