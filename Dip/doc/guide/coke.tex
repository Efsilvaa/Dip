\subsection{The Coke Supply Chain Problem (coke\_func.py and \\ coke\_instance.py)} \label{sbs:coke}

This case study is sourced from the Operations Research Web in the Department of Engineering Science TWiki \cite{coke} (and was originally adapted from Leyland et al. \cite{geoff_coke}). There are 6 coal mines that produce coal. The coal is transported from the 6 mines to a coke-making plant where it is converted to coke using ``thermal decomposition''. Every tonne of coke produced by thermal decomposition requires 1.3 tonnes of coal. From the coke-making plants the coke is transported to one of 6 customers. There are 6 locations where coke-making plants can be constructed. There are 6 different size plants that can be constructed at each location.

The size of a plant determines the coke processing level in kilotonnes/year the plant can produce. \Tabref{tab:plant_size} shows the different plant sizes with their corresponding processing levels and construction cost in million RMB.

To get this problem into Dippy we use the PuLP modelling language.  The formulation and solution functions from coke\_func.py are given below with a summary for each fragment.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,itemindent=0.75cm,labelwidth=.5cm,labelsep=.25cm,labelindent=0cm,align=left]
\item PuLP and Dippy are loaded in an identical way to bin\_pack\_func.py (see \scnref{sbs:binpack});

\item Define \lstinline{CokeProb}, a class that describes a coal-to-coke conversion and transportation problem;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=26,linerange=26-41]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Define the \lstinline{formulate} function, with a coke problem object as input;
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,itemindent=0.75cm,labelwidth=.5cm,labelsep=.25cm,labelindent=0cm,align=left]
\item Create a \lstinline{DipProblem} (with some display options defined);
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=43,linerange=43-49]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Add binary variables that determine the plant sizes at each location and (non-negative) integer variables that determine the flow (in coal from the mines to the plants and coke from the plants to the customers) transported through the network;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=51,linerange=51-58]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Add the objective of minimising total cost = building costs (converted from MRMB to RMB) + transportation costs;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=60,linerange=60-64]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Add constraints that limit the flow of coke out of a coke-making plant depending on the capacity of the plant constructed;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=66,linerange=66-70]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Add constraints that limit the number of coke-making plants built at any single location to be one (Note. there is a size with capacity 0 if no plant will be built);
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=72,linerange=72-74]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}

\item Add constraints to conserve flow at the mines ($\leq$ supply), coke-making plants (flow in $\geq$ coke-from-coal conversion rate $\times$ flow out) and customers ($\geq$ demand);
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=76,linerange=76-94]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}
\end{enumerate}

\item Define the \lstinline{solve} function as in bin\_pack\_func.py (see \scnref{sbs:binpack}).
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=133,linerange={133-133,141-147}]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_func.py}
\end{enumerate}

To solve an instance of the coke problem, the data needs to be specified and then the problem formulated and solved as demonstrated in the file coke\_instance.py.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,itemindent=0.75cm,labelwidth=.5cm,labelsep=.25cm,labelindent=0cm,align=left]
\item Load the requisite class and functions and define the entry point for Python;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=1,linerange=1-5]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\item Define the coke-from-coal conversion rate;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=6,linerange=6-6]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\item Define the supply of coal at the mines, the possible locations and construction costs of the coke-making plants and the demand for coke from the customers.
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=8,linerange=8-36]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\item Define the transportation costs from the mines to the coke-making plants and the coke-making plants to the customers in two tables and use the function \lstinline{read_table} (defined in coke\_func.py -- but omitted for brevity) to read these tables;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=38,linerange=38-61]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\item Define the transportation costs from the mine $\rightarrow$ plant and plant $\rightarrow$ customer costs;
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=63,linerange=63-64]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\item Create, formulate and solve this instance of the coke problem, then observe the solution (using the function \lstinline{print_var_table} -- defined in coke\_func.py -- but omitted for brevity).
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=66,linerange=66-87]{../../examples/Dippy/coke/coke_instance.py}

\end{enumerate}

The solution defines plants to be built at locations 1, 5 and 6 and also defines shipments of coal and coke between the mines, plants and customers (note that the output shown following has been edited a little to line up nicely):
