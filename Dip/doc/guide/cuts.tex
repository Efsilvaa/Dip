To add user-defined cuts in Dippy, we first define a new procedure for generating cuts and (if necessary) a procedure for determining a feasible solution. Within Dippy, this requires two new functions, \texttt{generate\_cuts} and (if necessary) \texttt{is\_solution\_feasible}. Both these functions have the same inputs as \texttt{branch\_method} (described in \scnref{scn:branch}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{prob} -- the \texttt{DipProblem} being solved;
\item \texttt{sol} -- an indexable object representing the solution at the current node.
\end{enumerate}
If a solution is determined not to be feasible either by \ac{DIP} (e.g., if the integer variables don't have integer values) or by \texttt{is\_solution\_feasible}, then cuts are generated (both by \texttt{generate\_cuts} and, if being used, the \ac{CGL}). Different problems benefit from different approaches to cuts as we demonstrate throughout this section. As in \scnref{scn:branch}, Python's scoping rules allow us to easily access the solution values of variables in our problem.

\subsection{Customised Cut Generation for the Capacitated Facility Location problem} \label{sbs:fac_cuts}

Marchand and Wolsey \cite{agg_mir2001} define many types of cuts for \ac{MILP} problems. One of these is the \textit{weighted inequality}. For each facility location $i$ and some subset $S_i (\subseteq 1, \ldots, n)$ of the products we can calculate
\[ \mu_i = W - \sum_{j \in S_i} w_j x_{ij} \]
and use it to generate a weighted inequality
\[ \sum_{j \in S_i} w_j x_{ij} + \sum_{j \notin S_i} (w_j - \mu_i)^+ x_{ij} \leq W - \mu _i \]
which forms a valid inequality for the facility location problem.

To get the subsets $S_i$ for each location from a fractional solution to the facility location problem we have assigned items to locations in a greedy way depending on their $x_{ij}$ values. Once the subsets are determined, we generate a set of weighted inequality cuts.

For brevity we have omitted the generation of $S_i$, but have shown how to build the set of cuts. Again, note that Python's scoping rules allow us to easily access the solution values of variables in our problem.

The effect of the weighted inequality cuts is shown in \scnref{scn:concl}.

\subsection{Customised Cut Generation for the Travelling Salesperson problem}

To add user-defined cuts for the \ac{TSP} in Dippy, we define a new procedure for generating cuts (as in \sbsref{sbs:fac_cuts}). For the \ac{TSP} (see \sbsref{sbs:tsp}) we generate cuts to eliminate subtours. In addition, as subtour elimination is not enforced by the original formulation (see \sbsref{sbs:tsp}), we also define \texttt{is\_solution\_feasible} to make sure a feasible solution contains no subtours.

The function for generating subtour elimination cuts finds all subtours in the current solution using the function \texttt{get\_subtour} (omitted here for brevity, \\ \texttt{get\_subtour} finds a subtour from a given node in \texttt{sol}) and adds a cut to eliminate them:
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=55,linerange=55-75]{C:/COIN/Dippy/examples/tsp.py}

The \texttt{get\_subtour} function can also be used to check if a solution contains any subtours (hence is infeasible):
\lstinputlisting[firstnumber=77,linerange=77-84]{C:/COIN/Dippy/examples/tsp.py}

\Figref{fig:tsp_prob} shows an example \ac{TSP} problem. \Figref{fig:tsp_cuts1} shows the subtours present in the initial solution. After \texttt{is\_solution\_feasible} identifies that there are subtours present in the solution, they are eliminated by cuts created in \\ \texttt{generate\_cuts}. \Figref{fig:tsp_cuts2} shows subtours present in a later solution that are similarly eliminated. After eliminating the necessary subtours, the optimal tour is found -- see \figref{fig:tsp_soln}.
