The development of mathematical modelling languages such as AMPL, GAMS, Xpress-MP and OPL Studio have made it easier to formulate mathematical models such as linear programmes, mixed-integer linear programmes and non-linear programmes for solution in solvers such as CPLEX, MINOS and Gurobi. However, some models cannot be solved using ``out-of-the-box'' solvers, so advanced techniques need to be added to the solver framework.

Many solvers, including CPLEX, Symphony and DIP, provide callback functions to enable users to customise the overall solution framework. However, this approach involves either expressing the mathematical formulation in a low level language such as C++ or Java, or implementing a complicated indexing scheme to be able to track formulation components such as variables and constraints between the mathematical modelling language and the solver's callback framework.

In this paper we present Dippy, a combination of the Python mathematical modelling language PuLP and the open source solver DIP. Using Dippy, users can express their model in a straightforward modelling language and use callback functions to access the PuLP model directly. We discuss the link between PuLP and DIP and give examples of advanced solving techniques expressed simply in Dippy.
