   abstract = {This paper presents an optimized solution of finding time-optimal trajectories for autonomous systems. These systems are subject to avoidance requirements, which include avoidance of collisions with other systems and obstacles, either static or dynamic. The necessary constraints for avoidance are added to a time-optimizing linear program by including a binary variable in the optimization. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This will be solved using AMPL mathematical programming language in conjunction with CPLEX optimization software.},

   abstract = {A new electronic theory of pericyclic chemistry and aromaticity, in line with the Robinson/Ingold electronic theory, is proposed. It is referred to as the Cplex-isoelectronic theory. This represents the first successful theory that is not based on quantum mechanics. There are three assumptions in this theory (1) ADEP, (2) SDEP and (3) SDSE. The ADEP assumption refers to isoelectron pairs moving in an antiperiplanar mode in relation to the plane of the molecule. SDEP relates to isoelectron pairs moving in a synperiplanar mode and SDSE refers to single isoelectrons moving in a synperiplanar mode. These assumptions are deduced from nucleophilic, radical addition, S(N)2 and S(N)2' reactions and the anomeric effect. Application of the ADEP concept to pericyclic reactions is supported by Complexity theory and backed up by direct empirical evidence from 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving nitronates and by its ability to predict the experimental data. The heavy atom effect provides experimental evidence for the SDSE mode in pericyclic reactions. The HOMO Diels-Alder is consistent with the SDEP concept. Evidence for the assumptions in aromatic compounds is found in the observation of a diamagnetic ring current in the presence of an applied field and in the applicability of the Biot-Savart law. The Cplex-isoelectronic theory makes different predictions from the present quantum chemical methods in some cases, namely the existence of suprafacial concerted thermal [2 + 2], [4 + 4], [6 + 2] and [6 + 6] cycloadditions, suprafacial concerted photochemical [4+2] and [6 +4] cycloadditions, stepwise [2+2+2] cycloadditions of ethyne, diamagnetic ring currents for some cyclic systems with 4n pi electrons. The available empirical evidence is consistent with these predictions.

   abstract = {Purpose: To develop an automated beam-orientation selection procedure for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and to determine if a small number of beams picked by this automated procedure can yield results comparable to a large number of manually placed orientations. Methods and Materials: The automated beam selection procedure maximizes an unconstrained objective function composed of target equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and critical structure dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints. Beam orientations are selected from a large feasible set of directions through a series of alternating fluence optimization and orientation alteration steps, until convergence to a stable orientation set. The fluence optimization step adjusts fluences to maximize the objective function. The orientation alteration step substitutes beams in the orientation set currently under consideration with beams of the parent set in the immediate angular vicinity; the altered orientation set is deemed current if it produces a higher objective function value in the fluence optimization step. Results and Conclusions: It is demonstrated, for prostate IMRT planning, that a modest number of appropriately selected beam orientations (3 or 5) can provide dose distributions as satisfactory as those produced by a large number of unselected equispaced orientations. Such selected beam orientations can reduce overall treatment time, thus making IMRT more clinically practical. &copy; 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.},

The approach is demonstrated by optimizing the beam orientation in two dimensions, with the objectives being formulated using planar geometry.  The traditional formulation of the objectives associated with the organs at risk has been modified to account for the use of complex dose delivery techniques such as beam intensity modulation.  The new algorithm attempts to replicate the approach of a treatment planner whilst reducing the amount of computation required. Hybrid genetic search operators have been developed to improve the performance of the genetic algorithm by exploiting problem-specific features.  The multiobjective genetic algorithm is formulated around the concept of Pareto optimality which enables the algorithm to search in parallel for different objectives. When the approach is applied without constraining the number of beams, the solution produces an indication of the minimum number of beams required.  It is also possible to obtain non-dominated solutions for various numbers of beams, thereby giving the clinicians a choice in terms of the number of beams as well as in the orientation of these beams.},

   abstract = {For some decades, radiation therapy has been proved successful in cancer treatment. It is the major task of clinical radiation treatment planning to realize, on the one hand, a high level dose of radiation in the cancer tissue in order to obtain maximum tumor control. On the other hand, it is obvious that it is absolutely necessary to keep the unavoidable radiation in the tissue outside the tumor, particularly in organs at risk, as low as possible. No doubt, these two objectives of treatment planning - high level dose in the tumor, low radiation outside the tumor - have a basically contradictory nature. Thus, there is need to compromise between overdosing the organs at risk and underdosing the target volume. Differing from the currently used time consuming interactive approach between dosimetrists and physicians, we consider the radiation therapy planning problem as a multiple objective linear programming problem and build a data base of relatively few efficient solutions representing the set of Pareto solutions. This data base can be easily scanned by physicians looking for an adequate treatment plan with the aid of an appropriate online tool. The paper includes a report on first numerical experiments and a list of further research topics which is hoped to stimulate interest of the OR community in a subject, where OR methods can make a difference for many individual's lives. &copy; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All three algorithms attempt to minimize a quadratic objective function of the dose distribution. It is shown that the algorithms are based on the common framework of Newton's method of multidimensional function minimization. The approximations used within this framework to obtain the different algorithms are described. The use of these algorithms requires that the number of weights of elemental dose distributions be equal to the number of sample points taken in the dose volume. The primary factor in determining how the algorithms are implemented is the dose computation model. Two of the algorithms use pencil beam dose models and therefore directly optimize individual pencil beam weights, whereas the third algorithm is implemented to optimize groups of pencil beams, each group converging upon a common point. All dose computation models assume that the irradiated medium is homogeneous. It is shown that the two different implementations produce similar results for the simple optimization problem of conforming dose to a convex target shape. Complex optimization problems consisting of nonconvex target shapes and dose limiting structures are shown to require a pencil beam optimization method.},

The Cimmino algorithm suitable for solving large systems of inequalities was adapted. Upper and lower dose constraints for planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) can be implemented into the algorithm. Using continuous and discrete kernels an intensity modulation was computed in a two-dimensional phantom with a PTV and low-dose region, and in the real three-dimensional patient planning. Intensity modulations obtained using continuous and discrete kernels were in good agreement.},

   abstract = {Synthesis of beam profiles for a given dose prescription is a central problem in radiotherapy. Care must be taken in the beam design to expose the tumour volume at a high level, to avoid significant irradiation of critical organs, and to minimize exposure of all other tissue. Use of the synthesis procedure known as alternating projections onto convex sets (POCS) is shown to be a viable approach to beam design. POCS is a powerful tool for signal and image restoration and synthesis. Convex sets of signals obeying desired constraint sets are first specified. Then, by repeated projections onto these sets, convergence is to a signal obeying all desired constraints if the constraint sets have a finite intersection. In this paper we apply the method of POCS to conformal radiotherapy dose computation. The performance of the method is shown through three representative examples.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the role of beam orientation optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to examine the potential benefits of noncoplanar intensity-modulated beams. Methods and Materials: A beam orientation optimization algorithm was implemented. For this purpose, system variables were divided into two groups: beam position (gantry and table angles) and beam profile (beamlet weights). Simulated annealing was used for beam orientation optimization and the simultaneous iterative inverse treatment planning algorithm (SIITP) for beam intensity profile optimization. Three clinical cases were studied: a localized prostate cancer, a nasopharyngeal cancer, and a paraspinal tumor. Nine fields were used for all treatments. For each case, 3 types of treatment plan optimization were performed: (1) beam intensity profiles were optimized for 9 equiangular spaced coplanar beams; (2) orientations and intensity profiles were optimized for 9 coplanar beams; (3) orientations and intensity profiles were optimized for 9 noncoplanar beams. Results: For the localized prostate case, all 3 types of optimization described above resulted in dose distributions of a similar quality. For the nasopharynx case, optimized noncoplanar beams provided a significant gain in the gross tumor volume coverage. For the paraspinal case, orientation optimization using noncoplanar beams resulted in better kidney sparing and improved gross tumor volume coverage. Conclusion: The sensitivity of an IMRT treatment plan with respect to the selection of beam orientations varies from site to site. For some cases, the choice of beam orientations is important even when the number of beams is as large as 9. Noncoplanar beams provide an additional degree of freedom for IMRT treatment optimization and may allow for notable improvement in the quality of some complicated plans.

   journal = {International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics},
   volume = {51},
   number = {5},
   pages = {1361-1370},
   abstract = {Purpose: To introduce the concept of pseudo beam's-eye-view (pBEV), to establish a framework for computer-assisted beam orientation selection in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to evaluate the utility of the proposed technique. Methods and Materials: To facilitate the selection of beam orientations for IMRT treatment planning, a scoring of beam direction was introduced. The score function was based on the maximum target dose deliverable by the beam without exceeding the tolerance doses of the critical structures. For the score function calculation, the beam portal at given gantry and couch angles was divided into a grid of beamlets. Each beamlet crossing the target was assigned the maximum intensity that could be used without exceeding the dose tolerances of the organs at risk (OARs) and normal tissue. Thereafter, a score was assigned to the beam according to the target dose delivered. The beams for the treatment were selected among those with the highest scores. In a sense, this technique is similar to the beam's-eye-view approach used in conventional radiation therapy, except that the evaluation by a human is replaced by a score function, and beam modulation is taken into account. Results: The pBEV technique was tested on two clinical cases: a paraspinal treatment and a nasopharyngeal cancer with both coplanar and noncoplanar beam configurations. The plans generated under the guidance of pBEV for the paraspinal treatment offered superior target dose uniformity and reduced OAR doses. For the nasopharyngeal cancer case, it was also found that the pBEV-selected coplanar and noncoplanar beams significantly improved the target coverage without compromising the sparing of the OARs. Conclusions: The pBEV technique developed in this work provides a comprehensive tool for beam orientation selection in IMRT. It is especially valuable for complicated cases, where the target is surrounded by several sensitive structures and where it is difficult to select a set of good beam orientations. The pBEV technique has considerable potential for simplifying the IMRT treatment planning process and for maximizing the technical capacity of IMRT. &copy; 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

   abstract = {A new approach for inverse treatment planning in radiation therapy with the multileaf collimator (MLC) technique is presented. The application of the MLC technique requires an algorithm for the computation of the positions or velocities of leaves as a function of time such that the prescribed dose in the patient space is obtained. The conventional method is to first determine the intensity distribution in the treatment space by applying some inverse treatment techniques. Then an MLC control algorithm which generates the determined intensity distribution is required. In this paper an MLC control algorithm not requiring an intensity distribution as an intermediate step is expressed. The algorithm uses the MLC leaf positions and delivery times (in multiple static treatments) directly in inverse treatment planning. The method is implemented to multiple static treatments but a modification to dynamical MLC techniques is possible. The numerical test is based on the search for a feasible solution but also the optimization (object function) based approach is formulated. The related feasible problem consists of a high-dimensional system of algebraic (in-) equations. It is solved by an iterative row action projection method. The applied algorithm is well suited and computationally robust for high-dimensional feasible problems.},

   abstract = {Computer-controlled multileaf collimators are receiving increasing acceptance for clinical use in radiation therapy due to their efficiency in shaping radiation fields. Because of the physical leaf width of the multileaf collimator, a smooth field contour prescribed by a physician is approximated by a staircase-shaped field boundary. The point of intersection with the prescribed field contour determines the error of the approximation and may affect the outcome of the treatment. This article provides analytically optimized solutions for leaf positioning based on two different geometric object functions.},
