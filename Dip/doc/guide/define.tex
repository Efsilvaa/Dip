In this section we consider the case studies used to demonstrate the use of Dippy. The case studies are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the bin packing problem;
\item the coke supply chain problem (a capacitated facility location problem within a transshipment problem);
\item the travelling salesperson problem;
\item the cutting stock problem;
\item the wedding planner problem (a set partitioning problem)
\end{enumerate}

In this section we will define the case studies in PuLP and demonstrate their solution in \ac{DIP} without any customisation.  Note that performance metrics throughout this paper were generated using Python 2.6.5 on a Dell Precision M4300 laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T9500@2.60GHz chipset and 777MHz, 3.50GB of RAM unless otherwise indicated. We used \ac{DIP} version 0.8.7 and Dippy version 1.0.8.
