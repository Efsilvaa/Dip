In this section we consider the case studies used to demonstrate the use of Dippy. The case studies are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the bin packing problem;
\item the coke supply chain problem (a capacitated facility location problem within a transshipment problem);
\item the travelling salesperson problem;
\item the cutting stock problem;
\item the wedding planner problem (a set partitioning problem)
\end{enumerate}

We will define the case studies in PuLP and demonstrate their solution in \ac{DIP} without any customisation. We used \ac{DIP} version 0.9.9 and Dippy version 1.9.9.
