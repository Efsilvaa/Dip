***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

Pre-built binaries are available for some versions of Dip on some platforms.
They can be downloaded at

  http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Dip

If you would like to build from source, you can obtain the source code for the
Dip package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended). For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on your
   machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain "handles 'https'
   scheme". On Windows, it is recommended to get the source with the SVN
   client TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.net).

   Assuming that you want to download a release version 0.9.12, as an example,
   you would execute the command

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Dip/releases/0.9.12 Dip-0.9.12

   You can similarly get source for the latest stable version or the trunk
   (development) version.

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Dip 
   and extract it. For example, for the release 0.9.12 you type

   gunzip Dip-0.9.12.tgz
   tar xvf Dip-0.9.12.tar

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g., Dip-0.9.12).
Then create a build directory and configure the package by typing

   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/

and the Dip Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Dip

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Dip successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/

***              BUILDING AND INSTALLING DIPPY                     ***
**********************************************************************

1. First, build and install Dip as above.

2. Set the environment variable COIN_INSTALL_DIR to the location of the installation directory.

***                  DIP EXAMPLES                                  ***
**********************************************************************

To get an idea of how DIP is used, take a look at the examples in the
directory Dip/examples/. To build a given application, change to the
appropriate subdirectory and type "make". For example, to build SmallIP, do

  cd Dip/examples/SmallIP
  make
